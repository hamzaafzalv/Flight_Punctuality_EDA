# Flight Punctuality EDA Repository ✈️📊

Welcome to the **Flight Punctuality EDA** repository! This repository contains project files used and created to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the flight punctuality of UK flights in June and July 2022. The analysis aims to gain insights into the factors influencing flight punctuality during these months. 🛫🛬

🛠️ **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Microsoft Powerpoint

## About the Project ℹ️

This project focuses on examining the flight punctuality of UK flights during June and July 2022. The datasets `June_22.csv` and `July_22.csv` include information about flight departure and arrival times, potential delays, flight routes, and other relevant attributes.

## EDA Process 📊🔍

The primary analysis is presented in the Jupyter Notebook `EDA.ipynb`, using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. The insights from the analysis are summarized in `analysis_report.md` and elaborated further in the analysis report files.
